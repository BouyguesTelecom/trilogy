## Description

`@trilogy-ds/assets` is a direct dependency of the `@trilogy-ds/react` package. It includes all open-source fonts and icons from Trilogy.

It provides to the `<Icon/>` component of the `@trilogy-ds/react` package, the path information from the `IconPath.ts` file (which is the paths to the icons) and the `IconName` file (which is an enum for the icon names).

## Installation

Download the package by running:

`npm install @trilogy-ds/assets`

## Scripts ðŸ’»

This package includes the following scripts using **npm**:

1. `optimise:icons`: This script uses [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to optimize all icons in the `assets/icons/all` directory. The optimized icons are stored in `lib/icons/all`.

2. `build`: This script first deletes the `lib` directory (if it exists). Then, it runs the `optimise:icons` script, compiles Typescript files, and finally, copies all fonts from `assets/fonts/` to `lib/fonts/`.

3. `pack`: This script runs the `npm pack` command which creates a tarball (.tgz file) of the package.

## License

This package is licensed under the ISC license.
