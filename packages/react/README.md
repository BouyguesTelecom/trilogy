### Trilogy Provider - Import directly css styles

The **TrilogyProvider** simplifies integrating Trilogy style into your app by wrapping your entry point with a provider. It offers two props for customization:

- `mangled` [optional]: Apply compressed styling for performance.
- `injectTrilogyAssets`: Inject Trilogy assets directly into the DOM.

#### Web Usage

1. Import the `TrilogyProvider` component:

   ```tsx
   import { TrilogyProvider } from "@trilogy-ds/react/lib/context/provider"
   ```

2. Wrap your app's root component with it:

   ```tsx
     <TrilogyProvider mangled injectTrilogyAssets>
       <App />
     </TrilogyProvider>
   ```

#### Native Usage

1. Import the `TrilogyThemeProvider` along with `SVGicons` & colors from [@trilogy-ds/assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trilogy-ds/assets) library:

   ```tsx
   import { TrilogyThemeProvider, defaultTheme } from '@trilogy-ds/react/lib/context/providerTheme'
   import { SVGicons } from '@trilogy-ds/assets/lib/iconsPath'
   ```

2. Wrap your app's root component with it:

   ```tsx
     const theme = {
       ...defaultTheme,
       icons: SVGicons,
       // here: override theme colors
     }

     <TrilogyThemeProvider theme={theme}>
       <AppNative />
     </TrilogyThemeProvider>
   ```
