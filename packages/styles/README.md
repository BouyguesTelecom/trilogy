`@trilogy-ds/styles` is a direct dependency of [@trilogy-ds/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trilogy-ds/react).

This package is a vital part of [Trilogy's design system](https://github.com/BouyguesTelecom/trilogy). Written in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). It provides a collection of SCSS styles used in Trilogy ( web only ). With a built-in framework for style definitions, and default themes, the package sets the foundation for stylizing Trilogy's components.
